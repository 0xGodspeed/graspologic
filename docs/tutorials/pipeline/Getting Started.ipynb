    "This tutorial is intended to help you get started with some of the tools and capabilities within Graspologic.  We'll focus primarily on using Graspologic through the `pipeline` module, which gives a slightly simpler and opinionated but less flexible approach toward the capabilities within the Graspologic library.\n",

    "In networks, the word `communities` describes a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other and more loosely connected to others. If you think about social networks, it should be pretty obvious that some groups of people have stronger connections to each other than to everyone else in the network, and it should also be obvious that there are some individuals that could conceivably be part of many communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we're going to define a community structure to mean \"every node in the network is in precisely one community\". I just referenced how there are circumstances in which you could arguably belong to many communities; the [Leiden](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08473) algorithm we are going to use just attempts to find the best community for us by maximizing [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)).  In other words, these communities should be _reasonable_ assertions, if not objectively optimal."
